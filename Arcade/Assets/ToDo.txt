To Do:
-------
- Implement 1-2 more styles of arcade cabinets.
- Chess set on games table, possibly other games as well
- Board games on shelves
- Game consoles on entertainment centre below big TV
- Scrolling ads on the big TV

Future Concepts to Consider:
-----------------------------
- Board game shelves will contain various table games for single and multiple players
- Could have 2 or 3 cabinets that share the same game allowing for multiple players in same game instance
- Players can use the bar area to buy cosmetic accessories for their avatar. These could include:
	- Character held items:
		- Drinks
		- Phones/Handheld Games
		- Toys related to available games
	- Clothing
		- Game themed shirts, pants, shoes, hats
		- Game themed backpacks
		- Solid colour options
	- Avatar Special Effects
		- Glowing spotlight
		- Glitter/shiny sparkes
		- Confetti
		- "WINNER!" above player's head
- Upon setting a new high-score, the big TV could display the player and the game associated.
- Speakers for announcements, including high-scores/broken records.
- Player who just achieved a high-score or other achievement could have a temporary avatar effect saying such.
- Interacting with the big TV could show UIs for high-scores, player stats and the like. 
- Friends list, could be accessed through the big TV or a handheld device.
- Friends list for inviting players to games, chatting etc.
- The Arcade could be hosted as instances on servers. Players can create their own Arcade instance amongst friends or join crowded public ones.
- Lobby-style Arcade instances, players are placed into one of these by default. Can support larger number of players, makes highscores harder to achieve etc.
- Reward system
	- Tokens to play games, can be purchased from the Bar, (perhaps with real money, otherwise they're earned over time)
	- Tokens could also be earned by getting achievements/breaking high scores
	- Rare avatar items
	- Game Perks
		- Items/Power-ups
		- Level Skips
		- Instant Replay (making quick save points, like in an emulator)
- Player Inventory System
- Trading System (Cosmetic Items, Game Perks? Tokens?)
